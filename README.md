Simulation1: At w_k=0, yd=2000, then yd=5000, and finally yd=8000. At w_k=10, it works the same way.
Simulation2: At w_k=10, delta=1000, then delta=3000, and finally delta=8000.
Simulation3: At yr(i)=10, ed_n=1, then ed_n=2, and ed_n=3. At yr(i)=20, ed_n=1, then ed_n=2, and ed_n=3. At yr(i)=30, ed_n=1, then ed_n=2, and ed_n=3.
